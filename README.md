# Learn HTMX

Learn HTMX using a Go server.

Learning from [HTMX & Go with ThePrimeagen](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/htmx) course on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com).

The key difference is that I use Go's _net/http_ instead of _echo_ for the server. This is only possible since
[Go 1.22](https://go.dev/blog/go1.22).

## To Do

- [ ] Use [slog](https://go.dev/blog/slog) for logging
- [ ] Add more info to the log. See older projects
- [ ] Use context to pass the template?
- [ ] Add error handling to the template Render
